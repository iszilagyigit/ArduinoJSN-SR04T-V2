# ArduinoJSN-SR04T-V2
Arduino project to connect 4 distance sensors to an arduino mini

## JSN SR04T V2.0 are in Mode 2

For this was needed 4 x 47K resistor (one for each modul).
See about Mode 2 in the file docs/JSN-SR04T-2.0.pdf

## Overview

Notes: issues with the schema below:
* sensor is JSN-SR04T-V2 and not HC-SR04 (didn't found any in fritzing)
* The buzzer has 3 pins (not 2 as in the picture)
